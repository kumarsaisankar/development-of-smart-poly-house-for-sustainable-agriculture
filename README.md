## Abstract
The present studies concentrate on the increase of quality agricultural yield with optimal resource utilization against adverse environmental conditions using agriculture 4.0. and deals with the implementation of sustainable green technological solutions known as poly- house farming using sensors, Internet of Things (loT), cloud and GSM technologies. nI this method, farming si performed ni a constrained environment created yb placing various sensors on the field and monitoring as wel as controling of various field parameters with the help of actuators based on their set thresholds. The parameters considered ni this case are temperature, humidity, soil moisture, CO, level, light intensity, rainfall condition, water tank level, inside the house. They are all maintained at the desired thresholds by automatically controlling corresponding actuators with the help of loT. The parameters sensed from these sensors are analyzed using the Thing speak server and recommendations are sent to the end-users through GSM for corrective action through the respective actuator such as fan and motor. Implementation of this work results ni the increase of yield with the optimal use of water.
